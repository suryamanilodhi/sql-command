difference between turncate and delete

*daelete 
DELETE is a Data Manipulation Language (DML) command.
It is used to remove rows from a table based on a specified condition.
It generates individual row deletions, meaning each row that satisfies the condition is deleted one at a time.
DELETE is slower than TRUNCATE because it generates more overhead by logging individual row deletions and potentially firing triggers associated with deletion.
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;


*truncate
TRUNCATE is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command.
It is used to remove all rows from a table.
It deallocates the data pages used to store the table's data and releases the associated storage space.


TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

TRUNCATE TABLE crimsons.blog
